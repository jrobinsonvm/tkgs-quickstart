## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service 
### Quick & Dirty - Getting Started Guide

The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service provides self-service lifecycle management of Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. You use the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service to create and manage Tanzu Kubernetes clusters in a declarative manner that is familiar to Kubernetes operators and developers.

vSphere with Tanzu transforms vSphere to a platform for running Kubernetes workloads natively on the hypervisor layer. When enabled on a vSphere cluster, vSphere with Tanzu provides the capability to run Kubernetes workloads directly on ESXi hosts and to create upstream Kubernetes clusters within dedicated resource pools.
